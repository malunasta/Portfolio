About me

My name is Magdalena Stachura. I am master of Managerial Econometrics on field Computer Science and Econometrics. I graduated from University of Economics & Management in Szczecin ,Poland. Running my websites business and working with enthusiastic web developers I became aware of what I really would like to do and where I’d like to be in few years time. I am passionate about computers and especially the internet. I believe starting my career as a Junior Web Application Tester is the right move towards Junior Web Developer role. My goal is to develop testing knowlage and technical skills. On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and researches.
